# Component Name

PrepareAndSendEmbedMessage

# Description

The PrepareAndSendEmbedMessage component is designed to take an input dictionary containing embed message information, prepare a Discord embed message object based on that information, and send it to a specified Discord channel.

# Input and Output Models

## Input

PrepareAndSendEmbedMessageInputDict - A dictionary with the following keys:
- `embed_info`: A dictionary containing information to create the embed message, including the message's title, description, color, and an array of field objects, where each field has a name and value.

## Output

PrepareAndSendEmbedMessageOutputDict - A dictionary with the following keys:
- `embed_message_sent`: A boolean value indicating whether the embed message was sent successfully.

The input and output models use Pydantic's BaseModel to handle validation and serialization.

# Parameters

- `discord_channel_id`: The Discord channel ID to send the embed message.
- `discord_api_token`: The Discord API token to authenticate the component.

Both parameters are strings and are read from environment variables using their corresponding keys.

# Transform Function

1. Extract `embed_info` from the input dictionary.
2. Create a new instance of the `discord.Client` class.
3. Define the `prepare_embed` function to convert the input `embed_data` dictionary into a Discord embed message object.
4. Define the `send_embed` asynchronous function to send the prepared embed message to the specified Discord channel.
5. Define the `on_ready` asynchronous function to handle the process of preparing and sending the embed message when the client is ready.
6. Set the `on_ready` function as the client's `on_ready` event handler.
7. Start the client and execute the `on_ready` function.
8. If the message sends successfully, return True for `embed_message_sent`. If an exception occurs, return False for `embed_message_sent`, and print the error message.

# External Dependencies

- `discord`: Library used to interact with the Discord API for sending embed messages.
- `dotenv`: Library used to load environment variables from a file.
- `fastapi`: Library used to build the component's API endpoint.
- `pydantic`: Library used for data validation and serialization of input and output models.

# API Calls

This component makes calls to the Discord API using the `discord.Client` class. The API calls include:
- `client.login`: Authenticates the component using the provided `discord_api_token`.
- `client.fetch_channel`: Retrieves the specified Discord channel by `discord_channel_id`.
- `channel.send`: Sends the prepared embed message to the fetched Discord channel.

# Error Handling

The component uses a try-except block to catch any exceptions that might occur during the process of preparing and sending the embed message. If an exception occurs, the component returns False for `embed_message_sent` and prints an error message indicating the problem.
